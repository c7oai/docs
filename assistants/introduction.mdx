Transform your customer service with intelligent, 24/7 AI-powered assistance that seamlessly integrates with your existing tools and knowledge base.

## What is an AI Assistant?

An AI Assistant is your intelligent virtual team member that handles customer inquiries automatically, provides accurate information from your knowledge base, and knows when to hand off complex issues to your human team. Think of it as a smart, tireless support agent that works around the clock.

Unlike simple chatbots with rigid scripts, AI Assistants understand natural language, learn from your business documentation, and provide personalized, context-aware responses to your customers.

## Key Capabilities

### Intelligent Conversation

Your AI Assistant engages customers in natural, helpful conversations:

- **Understands Intent**: Recognizes what customers are really asking for
- **Personality & Tone**: Configurable behavior that matches your brand voice
- **Context-Aware**: Remembers conversation history for coherent, multi-turn dialogues
- **Multi-Channel**: Deploys on your website, mobile apps, and messaging platforms

### Knowledge-Powered Responses

Connect your AI Assistant to comprehensive knowledge sources:

**Internal Knowledge Bases**
- Upload documents (PDF, DOCX, Markdown, text files)
- Create and manage structured documentation
- Organize content with tags and categories
- Semantic search to find the most relevant information

**External Integrations**
- **Zendesk**: Pull from your help center articles
- **Freshdesk**: Access your knowledge base
- **Confluence**: Connect to your team wiki
- **SharePoint**: Integrate enterprise documentation
- **Notion**: Link your team's workspace
- **Genesys**: Sync with your knowledge bases
- **Front**: Access help center content
- **Web Discovery**: AI-powered research from specific domains

Your AI Assistant automatically searches these sources to provide accurate, up-to-date answers.

### Smart Handoff & Escalation

Know when to get help from humans:

**Intelligent Escalation**

Define criteria for when conversations should be escalated:
- Customer explicitly requests a human agent
- Complex issues beyond the AI's scope
- Sensitive topics requiring human empathy
- After multiple unsuccessful responses
- Specific keywords or situations

**Seamless Integration with Your Tools**

When handoff is needed, the AI Assistant creates tickets or conversations directly in your existing platforms:

- **Support Platforms**: Zendesk, Freshdesk, Freshservice, Freshchat, Kustomer, Gorgias, Intercom
- **CRM Systems**: Salesforce, HubSpot
- **Communication Tools**: Slack (post to channels), Email notifications, Front
- **Live Chat**: Freshchat, Front, HubSpot Chat

The AI provides full conversation context, so your agents can pick up right where the bot left off.

### Customer Satisfaction Monitoring

Track how well your AI Assistant is performing:

- **Real-time CSat Analysis**: Continuous monitoring of customer sentiment
- **Conversation Categorization**: Automatically tag and classify interactions
- **Handoff Reason Tracking**: Understand why conversations are escalated
- **Feedback Collection**: Built-in thumbs up/down ratings

### Lead Generation & Actions

Go beyond answering questions:

- **Qualify Leads**: Capture and assess customer interest
- **Schedule Meetings**: Integrate with Calendly and HubSpot Meetings
- **Collect Information**: Custom forms and data collection
- **Present Actions**: Show relevant links and resources based on conversation context
- **Tag Customers**: Automatically categorize leads for follow-up

### Safety & Guardrails

Keep conversations on track and appropriate:

- **Topic Boundaries**: Define what the assistant should and shouldn't discuss
- **Automatic Decline**: Politely decline inappropriate requests
- **Forced Handoff**: Escalate after repeated guardrail violations
- **Business Hours**: Adjust messaging and behavior when your team is offline
